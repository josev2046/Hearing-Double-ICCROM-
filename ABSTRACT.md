**Abstract:**
This paper examines historically important personal sound archives by exploring their phenomenological meaning, symbolic interpretation, their influence on how listeners perceived the world through sound recordings from the 1990s, and their contemporary impact. Integral to reclaiming the archive and making it accessible, advanced technical procedures were deployed using AI, namely Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which the team regards will have a profound impact for audio producers beyond its application to this event.

Before becoming an academic, Reader Dr. David Dunkley Gyimah was a freelance BBC radio presenter and producer for London’s only talk radio show for Black Londoners in the early 1990s. Recordings of BBC GLR’s show were discarded by the station, but thirty years later duplicates were uncovered in Dr. Gyimah’s garage. The tapes were submitted to FIAT/IFTA’s Save our Archives and chosen for being historically important in a global competition. They featured rare interviews with figures such as Fela Kuti, the father of Afrobeat who denounces the music. Lord Herman Ouseley's newly elected position as the first Black person to head up Britain's Commission for Racial Equality, and his descriptions of his feelings and what was at stake for race relations, were significant, as was Nelson Mandela's 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium – poignant as the BBC celebrated 40 years of Live Aid.

The show was the first to be presented by second-generation Brits whose beliefs and attitudes were different to their parents, and as such, these archives offer rich insights into their phenomenology and lived experiences. This unique perspective meant that while an audience's decoding of radio (sound) is generally thought as imperceptible, the show's production methods significantly interrogated this process. It was made for a specific audience (Black listeners) but also needed to appeal to a wider demographic, so its creators intentionally utilised W.E.B. Du Bois’ "double consciousness", balancing their self-perception with the perceptions of non-Black listeners.

Integral to making the tapes accessible to the public involved a technical approach from José Velázquez, encompassing advanced digitisation techniques for legacy media formats and, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture within a bespoke Media Asset Management (MAM) system (Figure 1). RAG allows for a specific, and nuanced engagement with the historical tapes, as a solution which goes beyond this archival project and has the potential to be transformative for anyone accessing audio media, such as podcasts.

Further access is being considered for a modular exhibition design, where art meets technology (Figure 2). This design incorporates time-based media installations, utilising single-board computers (SBCs) and custom API development for dynamic content delivery and secure playback management. The project thereby highlights sound's potent role in research, revealing histories, shaping identity, and contributing to interdisciplinary research methodologies through its sonic dimensions.
